src stride 1, dst stride dim, spatial locality is fixed.
but temporal locality can be played with.

my cpu:
- 32K L1 cache
- 8 way
- 64 set
- 64 byte Block

split the two large matrices to small matrices, transpose per small matrix pair. Hope:
1. the data of the matrix pair all fit in the L1 cache
2. reduce the conflict miss

the worst case, dim is 1024N (4096B), then each row maps to the same set. The L1 cache can hold at most 8 rows at a time.
Each line can hold 16 ints.
