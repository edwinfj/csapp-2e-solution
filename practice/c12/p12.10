this question asks about semaphore implementation.
If the semaphore is implemented as a LIFO stack, when a thread blocks on a semaphore, its tid is pushed onto the stack. Upon a V operation, the top of the stack is popped out.
If so, a writer can wait till another writer blocks before calling V, thus it's always the writer that gets popped.
